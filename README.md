# Unemployment Analysis in India

## Project Overview

This project, completed as part of my **CodeAlpha** data science internship, focuses on analyzing unemployment data across different states in India. The objective is to perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand unemployment trends, particularly investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Dataset

The dataset contains monthly unemployment statistics for Indian states, including:
* State
* Date
* Frequency
* Estimated Unemployment Rate
* Estimated Employed
* Estimated Labour Participation Rate
* Region (Rural/Urban)



## Methodology

1.  **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and ensured data types were correct, especially converting the 'Date' column to a datetime object.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    * Analyzed the overall unemployment rate over time.
    * Visualized unemployment rates by state using bar charts and heatmaps.
    * Compared unemployment rates before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period (around March-May 2020).
3.  **Insight Generation**: Summarized key findings about which states were most affected and the sharp spike in unemployment during the lockdown.

## Results

The analysis revealed a significant spike in the unemployment rate across all Indian states during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020. States like **[Mention a high-unemployment state from your analysis]** saw a particularly sharp increase. The visualizations clearly show the pre- and post-pandemic contrast in the labor market.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed.
3.  Open the `Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.
